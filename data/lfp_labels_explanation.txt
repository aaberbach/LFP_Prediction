index_col = "start" should be used if loading with pandas

Columns:
P_or_T_above - Whether either the next trough or the next peak is has a Hilbert value above 2.
next_above - Whether (0) neither the next peak or trough is above the threshold, (1) the next peak is above threshold, (2) the next trough is above threshold and the next peak is not.
time_until_peak - Number of ms until the next peak.
time_until_trough - Number of ms until the next trough
peaks_above - How many consecutive peaks with a Hilbert value above 2 will come next.
troughs_above - How many consecutive troughs with a Hilbert value above 2 will come next.
next_peak - The value of the next peak from the hilbert.
next_trough - The value of the next trough from the hilbert.
index/start - The index of the data that the window starts at. The window is 25 ms long.
